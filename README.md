Original dataset has 10 columns, being index, 10 years date period, 4 columns for 4 product sales quantities and another 4 columns for 4 product sales revenues.I added additional 2 months sales data to the end of March 2023 for dashboard presentation purpose. And also assume it is a toy shop sales data.
